# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Coursera Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## About files
### run_analysis.R: is the script, one can run in Rstudio
### codebook.txt: indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information
### tidyData.txt: is the final tidy data set

## How the script works
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
